# What is it? 
-----

I have decided I want to create a random workout generator as it's aligned with my current personal goals. I also took inspiration from another developer who has made similar before. I did not copy any code but took inspiration from the idea. 

# What does it do? 
---- 

This will create a random workout/exercise whether that's cardio or lifting weights. 
**The generator should push out examples such us:** 
- Push ups: 3 sets, 10 reps 
- Pull ups: 3 sets, 8 reps  
- Run: 5km 8:00 pace # Portfolio-Project---Mixed-Messages
